        The motivation of the app is to support people who are using maps navigation to reach their
        destination by feet. Imagine you are in an unknown city and you want to use maps navigation
        to reach your destination. You start your navigation on the phone, lock your screen, put the
        phone in your pocket, maps navigation is running in the background and you start walking.
        The direction notifier will notify you when significant direction changes appears. So the
        intention of the app is not to notify you when maps navigation is running in the foreground
        like in a car, better have both hands constantly on your steering wheel rather than look to
        your watch ;)\n\n\n\n
