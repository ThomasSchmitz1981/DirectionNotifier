    JUST FOR TESTING INTERESTED PEOPLE \n\n
    Go to Settings -> Accessibility and activate the Direction Notifier Service
    to get direction notifications on your ticwatch while google maps navigation is running.\n\n
    NEW FEATURES: \n\n
    - View Direction Bitmap via "view photo" through notification on your ticwatch\n
    - Invoke "Exit navigation" through notification on your ticwatch
    \n\n
    PLEASE NOTE: \n\n
    The google maps notification is not fully synchronized on time with notifications for your ticwatch.
    The reason for that is to reduce traffic between phone and ticwatch.
    The functionaltiy of the service can be affected by a newer version of google maps.\n\n\n\n
